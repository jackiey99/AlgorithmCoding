# AlgorithmCoding

As part of the efforts to prepare for coding interviews, I practiced some problems in Python/C++ on leetcode as well as other CP websites like codeforces.
I list some of the interesting and/or challenging problems as follows.

## Combinatorial games
* [codeforces 1312F attack on red kingdom](https://codeforces.com/contest/1312/problem/F) \[[Solution](codeforces/1312F_attack_on_red_kingdom.cpp)\]: this problem touches upon the topic of combinatorial games. Refer to the [article](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66040) on codeforces or a Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymoSFrDmkMY&list=PLOzRYVm0a65fY-Vh8Caiv3wAYmDd7SnrN&index=7)

## Dynamic programming
* [codeforces 1324F maximum white subtree](https://codeforces.com/contest/1324/problem/F)\[[Solution](codeforces/1324F_maximum_white_subtree.cpp)\]: dp on tree with a special technique called rerooting

## Trees
* [codeforces 1328E tree queries](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/E)\[[Solution](codeforces/1328E_tree_queries.cpp)\]: application of lca. Learn a useful technique for lca, i.e., binary lifting, which is efficient for multiple lca queries.

## Two Pointers
* [Leetcode 1574 Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-34/problems/shortest-subarray-to-be-removed-to-make-array-sorted/)\[[Solution](leetcode/1574_shortest_subarray_to_be_removed_to_make_array_sorted.cpp)\]: interesting two pointer problem
* [Leetcode 1004 Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)\[[Solution](leetcode/1004_max_consecutive_ones_iii.cpp)\]: two pointer problem

## Greedy
* [Leetcode 1585 Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-transformable-with-substring-sort-operations/)\[[Solution](leetcode/1585_check_if_string_is_transformable_with_substring_sort_operations.cpp
)\]: use the bubble sort idea

* [codeforces 1187D Subarray Sorting](https://codeforces.com/contest/1187/problem/D)\[[Solution](codeforces/1187D_subarray_sorting.cpp
)\]: use BIT to query/update the left boundary of each element

# AlgorithmCoding

As part of the efforts to prepare for coding interviews, I practiced some problems in Python/C++ on leetcode as well as other CP websites like codeforces.
I list some of the interesting and/or challenging problems as follows.

## Combinatorial games
* [codeforces 1312F attack on red kingdom](https://codeforces.com/contest/1312/problem/F) \[[Solution](codeforces/1312F_attack_on_red_kingdom.cpp)\]: this problem touches upon the topic of combinatorial games. Refer to the [article](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66040) on codeforces or a Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymoSFrDmkMY&list=PLOzRYVm0a65fY-Vh8Caiv3wAYmDd7SnrN&index=7)

## Dynamic programming
* [codeforces 1324F maximum white subtree](https://codeforces.com/contest/1324/problem/F)\[[Solution](codeforces/1324F_maximum_white_subtree.cpp)\]: dp on tree with a special technique called rerooting
